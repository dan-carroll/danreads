intro: |
  Jubal Sackett’s urge to explore drove him westward, and when a Natchez priest asks him to undertake a nearly impossible quest, Sackett ventures into the endless grassy plains the Indians call the Far Seeing Lands. He seeks a Natchez exploration party and its leader, Itchakomi. It is she who will rule her people when their aging chief dies, but first she must vanquish her rival, the arrogant warrior Kapata. Sackett’s quest will bring him danger from an implacable enemy . . . and show him a life—and a woman—worth dying for.

Jubal, known as the "Quiet One", is a thinking man. But also a self-styled loner. He prefers wandering the mountains, wide open places, and wooded areas.

He ends up with a life-long friend who had started out trying to kill him. No anymosity toward the one trying to kill you. Or you killing him. It is the indian way to test your own skills and strength againt other warriors.

This is a great read. Plenty of action and adventure with some surpriing twists. Typical Western. Strife, heroism, love. All of the ingredients of a great story with a final twist as a surprise ending.

Louis L’Amour’s Sacketts saga continues, not as a continuous story line but through the telling of individual Sackett clan members. As a clan though, the stories aren't always about single Sackett clan memebers. So keep reading The Sacketts series. Entertaining stories at their best.
