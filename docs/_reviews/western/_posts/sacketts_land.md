intro: |
  After discovering six gold Roman coins buried in the mud of the Devil’s Dyke, Barnabas Sackett enthusiastically invests in goods that he will offer for trade in America. But Sackett has a powerful enemy: Rupert Genester, nephew of an earl, wants him dead. A battlefield promise made to Sackett’s father threatens Genester’s inheritance.


  So on the eve of his departure for America, Sackett is attacked and thrown into the hold of a pirate ship. Genester’s orders are for him to disappear into the waters of the Atlantic. But after managing to escape, Sackett makes his way to the Carolina coast. He sees in the raw, abundant land the promise of a bright future. But before that dream can be realized, he must first return to England and discover the secret of his father’s legacy.

This is not a typical American Western. It is the first of the Sackett series by Louis L'Amour. Which becomes the premiere Western tracing the family's story from the Old World to the New World and into the ever expanding Western frontier.

This story begins in the fens of Eastern England (1599) and ends up in the wilds of the southern part of the New World in what would become the Province of Carolina.
