summary: |
  Mike Harmon's commando-quality retainers agree: their leader, code-named Ghost, is a peculiar one. An ex-Navy-SEAL, there is no stronghold he cannot penetrate, no target he can't take out. But Ghost is also a man struggling to keep the animal inside at bay and his twisted sexual desires satisfied with a rock-hard integrity and incredible force of will.


  Now Harmon and his militia have been hired to rescue the daughter of a powerful political mover in America, kidnapped into the Eastern Europe sex trade.


  Welcome to the Balkan Route: a notorious pathway for human trafficking carved with blood and brutality and passing through Serbia and Montenegro, Croatia, Albania, Macedonia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Kosovo to the heart of darkness itself: sexual snuff houses where powerful politicians pay to rape and murder young women for kicks. Turns out some of those politicians hail from Washington, D.C.


  But now the Route is about to be re-Routed, and the balance of power is about to shift dramatically - to the smoking muzzle of one very angry ex-SEAL's M-4.


  Sometimes it takes a bad man to destroy an even more terrible evil. And the baddest of them all is Ghost. They'll be sorry they made his girls cry.

intro: |
  Former SEAL Michael Harmon ([Ghost](/reviews/military_fiction/ghost.html), [Kildar](/reviews/military_fiction/kildar.html)) has a pretty good life. He's settled down in the country of Georgia and built a solid commando-quality militia out of his local retainers. The Keldara have an ancient history of being first-class mountain warriors and all they needed was a few million in modern weapons and training to bring them up to speed.


  Now, with the Keldara keeping the area safe from Chechen raiders, and the various other terrorists that want Ghost's head on their wall, he can settle back, relax in his harem and drink a few beers. However, a US senator has a problem. A "major financial contributor's" daughter has been kidnapped into the labyrinthian depths of the Balkans sex-slave trade. The US government has been unable to find her and the Senator is –very– interested in changing that condition. Five million dollars interested.


  As Ghost and his Keldara warriors blast a gaping hole through the middle of the trade, it quickly becomes apparent that there is more to the mission than a "poor missing waif." There's a rot underneath, and the stench is coming from the very floor of the Capitol.


  Being at war with Albanian gangs is one thing. Taking on Washington is a different ball game. But Ghost never believed in fighting fair.
