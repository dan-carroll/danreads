intro: |
  As always, Reacher has no particular place to go, and all the time in the world to get there. One morning he ends up in a town near Pleasantville, Tennessee.


  But there’s nothing pleasant about the place.


  In broad daylight Reacher spots a hapless soul walking into an ambush. “It was four against one” . . . so Reacher intervenes, with his own trademark brand of conflict resolution.


  The man he saves is Rusty Rutherford, an unassuming IT manager, recently fired after a cyberattack locked up the town’s data, records, information . . . and secrets. Rutherford wants to stay put, look innocent, and clear his name.


  Reacher is intrigued. There’s more to the story. The bad guys who jumped Rutherford are part of something serious and deadly, involving a conspiracy, a cover-up, and murder—all centered on a mousy little guy in a coffee-stained shirt who has no idea what he’s up against.


  Rule one: if you don’t know the trouble you’re in, keep Reacher by your side.

Jack Reacher, the wanderer that he is, always looks for a meal when he hits town. And some good jazz if it's available–dinner and a band being his cup of tea.

Of course he is comfortable enough with the seedier side of town. Finding some music upon hitting Nashville is easy enough. But the joint he enters isn't big on serving food.

The band has finished their sets for the night and with no food forthcoming, Reacher leaves. Crossing by an alley he practically runs into the band.

With a short conversation, Reacher discovers the band hasn't been paid and a guitar has been taken. Reacher, being Reacher, decides to intervene on their behalf. This is where the story starts. And there is so much more.

Wanderer, man of principle, and a hero to some. Here is another entertaining story where our hero stands up for the little guy and metes out justice–Jack Reacher style.

This is a slightly different take for a Jack Reacher story. Lee Child has brought in his brother Andrew to co-author The Sentinel. Still a great story so get yourself a copy and enjoy.
