intro: |
  In a Chicago suburb, a dentist is met in his office parking lot by three men and ordered into the trunk of his Lexus. On a downtown sidewalk, Jack Reacher and an unknown woman are abducted in broad daylight by two men - practiced and confident - who stop them at gunpoint and hustle them into the same sedan. Then Reacher and the woman are switched into a second vehicle and hauled away, leaving the dentist bound and gagged inside his car with the woman's abandoned possessions, two gallons of gasoline. . . and a burning match.


  The FBI is desperate to rescue the woman, a Special Agent from the Chicago office, because the FBI always - always - takes care of its own, and because this woman is not just another agent. Reacher and the woman join forces, against seemingly hopeless odds, to outwit their captors and escape. But the FBI thinks Jack is one of the kidnappers - and when they close in, the Bureau snipers will be shooting to kill.

Here we go. A great, entertaining read. This story shows that Lee Child is a very capable story-teller. And it's only his second one.

Our hero is kidnapped while helping out an injured woman. He probably could have taken out the thugs but there were a few too many bystanders around who could have been hit by any gunfire. Besides, we need this to continue to have a story.

It would be way too easy to describe some of the action in this story but I'm not here to spoil it for anyone. That said, read this book. It is a decidely entertaining Action Romp.

We've bot bad guys from a militia group, FBI agents wanting one of theirs back, Reacher thwarting the bad guys plans, and a fine looking damsel in distress. Who happens to be a bit of a badass herself. And who knows, maybe there are some romantic sparks here to light up Reacher. Read the story. You won't be disappointed.
