intro: |
  A hardened group of survivors fights back against a zombie plague that has brought down civilization.


  With the world consumed by a devastating plague that drives humans violently insane, what was once a band of desperate survivors bobbing on a dark Atlantic ocean has now become Wolf Squadron, the only hope for the salvation of the human race. Banding together with what remains of the U.S. Navy, Wolf Squadron, and its leader Steve Smith, not only plans to survive; he plans to retake the mainland from the infected, starting with North America.


  Smith's teenage daughters have become zombie hunters of unparalleled skill, both at land and on the sea, and they may hold the key to the rebirth of civilization on a devastated planet.

The folks of Wolf Squadron are building back some basic infrastructure. They have island bases and flotillas. Are working with naval vessels and the federal government remnants with plans to start taking back the mainland. Plus obtain resources to mass produce vaccine.

The story grows in scope and intensity. And is still a can't-put-it-down read. This volume is intended to be the final one in the series.

**Spoiler:** There is more to come. Additional volumes to the main story. Along with some short-story volumes to bring additional, scattered stories into the fold.

And more back-story stories going back to the beginning of the plague, then moving forward. Some parallel timelines in other locations. Very interesting stories to continue the narrative and not leave readers totally hanging.
