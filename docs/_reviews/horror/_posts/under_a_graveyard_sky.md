summary: |
  “If you think the zombie apocalypse will never happen, if you’ve never been afraid of zombies, you may change your mind after reading *Under a Graveyard Sky*... Events build slowly in the book at the outset, but you can’t stop reading because it’s like watching a train wreck in slow motion: inexorable and horrible. And the zombie apocalypse in these pages is so fascinating that you can’t stop flipping pages to see what happens next.”—*Bookhound*

intro: |
  A family of survivors who fight back against a zombie plague that has brought down civilization. Zombies are real. And we made them. Are you prepared for the zombie apocalypse? The Smith family is – with the help of a few Marines.

  When an airborne “zombie” plague is released, bringing civilization to a grinding halt, the Smith family – Steven, Stacey, Sophia and Faith – take to the Atlantic to avoid the chaos. The plan is to find a safe haven from the anarchy of infected humanity. What they discover, instead, is a sea composed of the tears of survivors and a passion for bringing hope.

  For it is up to the Smiths and a small band of Marines to somehow create the refuge that survivors seek in a world of darkness and terror. Now with every continent a holocaust and every ship an abattoir, life is lived beneath a graveyard sky.

Definitely a horror series – Zombies – but horror is classified as science fiction quite often. And there is science involvoed here. No zombie voodoo, enchanted artifact, or medical lab accident. This zombie plague is a result of a mad scientist enhancing a series of viruses and releasing his product on the world.

The author did his homework showing real science behind the central theme here. And his military background shows again as this title could be classified as military fiction.

This is a great story line. Plenty of action with all the thrills and chills one could stand.

This is such a believable story. The zombies do die in the normal way though their pain centers don't seem to function so they must be killed outright. And their bite is dangerous. So watch out for the rabid crazies.

And the survival story here ends up taking central stage. People need to band together, share skills and resources, and watch each others' backs.

The military aspects of the story are workable. This story could be used as a manual on apocalyptic survival. That is what really gets me in zombie stories – the survival aspect.

For horror buffs, zombie lovers, and military survivalists – or plain adrenaline junkies – this is a great read for you all.
