summary: |
  Gateway HD 36951 lies in ruins. All survivors slaughtered. A single, truncated message sent back to Earth. Something very bad indeed is afoot, and the A.S.S. Vorpal Blade (read: nuclear submarine converted to warp-drive space ship) is sent to investigate. But the ferocious, voracious enemy Dreen wait for no man (or other carbon-based lifeform), and the Blade and her crew are soon the only hope for an alien species pushed to the brink of extinction. Turn back and abandon a new ally or face a heavily-armed Dreen destroyer head on.

intro: |
  In the midst of recovering from their successful if casualty prone first mission, the crew of the Alliance Space Ship "Vorpal Blade" are suddenly scrambled back into action. All other priorities take second place as word arrives on earth of a gate colony which has fallen to an unidentified alien assault. As the only space ship currently available to the Human-Adar Alliance, the "Vorpal Blade" is dispatched to find out what happened to the colony, rescue any survivors and learn the identity of the attackers.


  With new complexities added to the universe started in the novel "[Into the Looking Glass](/reviews/science_fiction/into_the_looking_glass.html)" and continued in "[Vorpal Blade](/reviews/science_fiction/vorpal_blade.html)", "Manxome Foe" continues the tradition of non-stop action, valorous if quirky characters and rigorous science drawn from the frontiers of current theory. The odd-ball crew of the "Vorpal Blade" is an unlikely savior of earth, but none dare say they quail at engaging the *Manxome Foe*.

The people of Earth are in an alliance with an alien civilization. We have regular gate travel between points on Earth and other planets. And colonies on other planets.

Plus earthlings have a warp-drive, battleship of sorts that gets called into action when a colony is wiped out by another alien race. *Manxome Foe* is another great read from story-teller extraordinaire, *[John Ringo](/authors/john_ringo.html)*.
