My first Terry Brooks read was his first book, *The Sword of Shannara*. That made me a fan. Great read. Great first novel from an excellent storyteller.

I kept an eye out for his next works but there were a few years in between editions of his first trilogy. But well worth it. They were all great reads.

I have read other works of his through the years. And have totally enjoyed them all. Then to my surprise, the second book from his first trilogy – *The Elfstones of Shannara* – appeared on Netflix as *The Shannara Chronicles*.

The first two seasons of *The Shannara Chronicles* were a revelation. I finally realized that the lands here were the North America continent of the future – not some made up fairytale land. I sure hope the third season of *The Shannara Chronicles* makes it to screen someday soon.
