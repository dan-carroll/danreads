We would like to take this time to assure our visitors that we will not collect any user information that is not absolutely necessary. Our goal here is to provide a friendly service by reviewing books that we have found interest in. And hopefully you will also find some interesting reads here.

#### Information Collected

We will collect browser details such as IP addresses, referrer pages, browser type, operating system, pages visited, and time spent here. This information is for our own use and will not be shared. We are hoping to get an idea of who is visiting, where you may be coming from, and what you find interesting.

In the future we may ask if you would be interested in commenting on our articles or receiving updates on our site through a newsletter. At that time we would ask you to provide a name and email address. This would be only used to identify who is commenting. Or who is ready to receive our next newsletter.

#### Third Parties

Google Analytics will be used to track and report on website traffic. This data is stored by Google and agregated there. To learn more, follow this link to [Wikipedia's Google Analytics page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics){:target="_blank"}.

Our hosting server also logs information from visitors such as ip addresses, pages visited, referral site, and errors. For more information on web server logs, follow [this link](https://www.timeatlas.com/web-server-logs/){:target="_blank"}.

#### Sharing of User Information

We do not share or sell user information. Google Analytics will have some network information but not any personal user information. We could possibly be compelled to disclose what we do have for legal purposes. But, really, this is just a site about book reading.

#### Your Rights

Since we do not collect any personal data at this time, there really is no reason to worry about it. Your network and page action data is something that servers normally collect any way. We monitor this data to get an idea of where our visitors may be coming from and what pages are being viewed. If you do not wish for us to have this data then do not visit.

#### Contacting Dan Reads

If you would like to comment on any of our pages, we do not have comments set up on this site. But you may contact us via any of our social media sites listed in the pages footer. For direct access, send email to danreads at dmcarroll dot net. Email messages are scanned for spam. To insure yours is read, describe the purpose of your message in the subject line.
