Okay, this is a bit late. For Spring housecleaning. And for porting this site from the old hosting service to GitHub Pages. But it is done now.

Had some in-site broken page and image links. Fixed now (I hope). Also replaced some placeholder text. Even started a couple of reviews. Still in the drafts folder but I have a place to start.

Hopefully you all like what you find here. I'll be ramping up to add more content. Later!
