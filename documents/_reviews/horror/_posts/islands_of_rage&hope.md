intro: |
  With the world consumed by a devastating plague that drives humans violently insane, what was once a band of desperate survivors bobbing on a dark Atlantic ocean has now become Wolf Squadron, the only hope for the salvation of the human race. Banding together with what remains of the U.S. Navy, Wolf Squadron, and its leader Steve Smith, not only plans to survive—he plans to retake the mainland from the infected, starting with North America.


  The next step: produce a vaccine. But to do that, Wolf Squadron forces led by Smith’s terrifyingly precocious daughters Sophia and Faith, must venture into a sea of the infected to obtain and secure the needed materials. And if some of the rescued survivors turn out to be more than they seem, Smith just might be able to pull off his plan.


  Once more, exhausted and redlining Wolf Squadron forces must throw themselves into battle, scouring the islands of the Atlantic for civilization's last hope.

This story is becoming increasingly more interesting. A true can't put it down read. John Ringo is a true master in action thrillers.

Now that our heroes are bringing people together and building a sizable force, it is time to stop being victims and go on the offensive. Time to plan on retaking the mainland from the hordes of infected insane. Can they rebuild a country? Then the world?
