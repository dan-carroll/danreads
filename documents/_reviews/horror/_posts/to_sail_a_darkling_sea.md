summary: |
  "Not only has Ringo found a mostly unexplored corner of the zombie landscape, hes using the zombie frame to tackle a broader theme: the collapse and rebirth of civilization. The zombie scenes are exciting, sure, but its the human story that keeps us involved. A fine series."â€”Booklist

intro: |
  **A World Cloaked in Darkness**


  With human civilization annihilated by a biological zombie plague, a rag-tag fleet of yachts and freighters known as Wolf Squadron scours the Atlantic, searching for survivors. Within every abandoned liner and carrier lurks a potential horde, safety can *never* be taken for granted, and death and turning into one of the enemy is only a moment away.


  **The Candle Flickers**


  Yet every ship and town holds the flickering hope of survivors. One and two from lifeboats, a dozen from a fishing village, a few hundred wrenched by fury and fire from a ship that once housed thousands...


  **Light a Flame**


  Now Wolf Squadron must take on another massive challenge: clear the assault carrier *USS Iwo Jima* of infected before the trapped Marines and sailors succumb to starvation. If Wolf Squadron can accomplish that task, an even tougher trial waits: an apocalyptic battle to win a new dawn for humanity. The war for civilization begins as the boats of the Wolf Squadron become a beacon of hope on a Darkling Sea.

Zombies are one thing but surviving is paramount. This book is a handbook for surviving an apocalypse while collecting survivors and supplies. And it is extremely entertaining.

John Ringo has done it again. Created a highly entertaining story that is hard to put down. And he has down it with believable characters, situations, and adventure with plenty of action. 

The breakout surprise here is our heroes teenage daughters who steal the show. You will love these characters. 'Nuff said. No spoilers.
