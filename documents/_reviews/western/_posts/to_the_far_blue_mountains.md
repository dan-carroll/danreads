intro: |
  Barnabas Sackett was leaving England to make his fortune in the New World. But as he settled his affairs, he learned that a royal warrant had been sworn out against him and that men were searching for him in every port. At issue were some rare gold coins Sackett had sold to finance his first trip to the Americas—coins believed to be part of a great treasure lost by King John years before.


  Believing that Sackett possesses the rest of the treasure, Queen Bess will stop at nothing to find him. If he’s caught, not only will his dream of a life in America be lost, but he will be brutally tortured and put to death on the gallows.

Barnabas Sackett is no ordinary Englishman. To find his way back to his love who has gone ahead to America–and to fulfill his dream of going *To the Far Blue Mountains*–he must escape prison and evade the Queen's men and find a ship to take him to the New World.

Story telling at it's finest by a master storyteller, Louis L’Amour. The settling of America began first with coastal outposts by those with a wanderlust and a vision. The Sackett family saga is a fictional account of the settling and westward expansion of America. And Louis L’Amour writes a good read.
