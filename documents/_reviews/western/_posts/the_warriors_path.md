intro: |
  When Yance Sackett’s sister-in-law is kidnapped, he and Kin race north from Carolina to find her. They arrive at a superstitious town rife with rumors—and learn that someone very powerful was behind Diana’s disappearance.


  To bring the culprit to justice, one brother must sail to the exotic West Indies. There, among pirates, cutthroats, and ruthless “businessmen,” he will apply the skills he learned as a frontiersman to an unfamiliar world—a world where one false move means instant death.

Another great read. Interesting story. From the Carolina/Tennessee mountains to New England to the Carribean–in the early 1600s.

Plenty of detail for visualization but not too much to bore the reader with. I could visualize much of the areas traveled. Some of it familiar in varying degrees.

Our heroes save some girls from kidnappers. Not only once, but twice. Plenty of action and adventure with some thrills and romance.

Typical Western fair. The good guys win out in the end. The bad guys receive their just desserts. And another day dawns.
