intro: |
  After saving America from Middle Eastern terrorists, even Mike Harmon and the Keldara could use a vacation. Of course, the Kildar’s idea of a vacation includes taking down pirates in the Singapore Straits. But when he finds computer chips designed to run nuclear reactors in the pirate booty, Harmon has a new mission thrust upon him—discover how bottom feeding thieves got their hands on top-secret technology.


  The chips are headed for newly democratic Myanmar, a country vital to American interests in the region.  Now Harmon finds himself in a desperate race to learn who stole the chips and why. From glittering Hong Kong to the slums of Thailand to the swamps of Myanmar, Harmon and his Keldara team follow a trail of death and deceit across the glittering underbelly of Southeast Asia.  


  And as the path winds through dark jungle and slave labor camps to the heart of newborn democracy, Harmon must devise a way to prevent the nasty overthrow of a nation’s capital by totalitarian tyrants.  But if there’s one thing Mike and the Keldara specialize in, it’s doing what it takes to give freedom a chance.

Globe-trotting military adventurers are bound to end up in Southeast Asia eventually. Piracy, nuclear technology, slave labor and tyrants bent on world conquest–or at least their part of the world–with fledgling democracy in the balance. Bring in the good guys who are truly bad and teach the *bad boys* a lesson.

Gotta love a rollicking – Rock-N-Roll – adventure. This is story-telling at it's best. Thanks again John Ringo and, you too, Ryan Sear.
