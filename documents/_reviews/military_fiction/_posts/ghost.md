summary: |
  Former SEAL Michael Harmon, Team Name "Ghost", retired for service injuries, is not enjoying college life. But things are about to change, if not for the better.


  When he sees a kidnapping, a series of – at the time logical – decisions leave him shot to ribbons and battling a battalion of Syrian commandos with only the help of three naked co-eds who answer to the names *Bambi*, *Thumper* and *Cotton Tail*. A fast-paced, highly-sexual, military-action thriller that ranges from a poison factory in the Mideast to the Florida Keys to Siberia, the novel will keep you guessing what twisted fate will bring next for the man once known as . . . Ghost. Keep an eye on him or . . . poof, he'll be gone.

intro: |
  Retired after 15 years in special ops due to a myriad of physical ailments, Michael Harmon is having trouble fitting into his new role as a University of Georgia undergrad. Instead, Ghost (named for his uncanny ability to "blend") likes to stalk unknowing coeds and speculate on the carnal possibilities. But when a van-load of men suddenly abduct a blonde that Ghost had been following, he gives chase and follows the van to a deserted warehouse, where he uncovers a terrorist plot to kidnap and brutalize dozens of innocent American women.


  Ghost's military training kicks in, and after killing most of the jihadists within the warehouse, he tracks a truckload of sedated abductees to a 727 at an Atlanta airport and hitches a ride to Syria. In the action that ensues, Ghost unearths plots involving WMD production, rogue nukes, sexual slavery, and the assassination of world leaders – all of which culminates in a breathtaking showdown at (where else?) a strip joint in Amsterdam, in the champagne room!

Action! Thrills! Adventure! With military and terrorists aspects. And military tech to boot.

A hero for the times. One that is both believable and endearing. And a cold, calculating killer when need be.

Reminiscent of the Executioner/Mack Bolan series. With a little something... extra. Don't miss this great read from John Ringo, a great military action storyteller.
