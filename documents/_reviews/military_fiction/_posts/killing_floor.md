summary: |
  Jack Reacher visits a town without pity in the first novel in Lee Child's New York Times best-selling series.


  Ex-military policeman Jack Reacher is a drifter. He's just passing through Margrave, Georgia, and in less than an hour, he's arrested for murder. Not much of a welcome. All Reacher knows is that he didn't kill anybody. At least not here. Not lately.


  But he doesn't stand a chance of convincing anyone. Not in Margrave, Georgia. Not a chance in hell.

intro: |
  From its chilling opening page, you know all is not well in Margrave, Georgia. The sleepy, forgotten town hasn't seen a crime in decades, but within the span of three days it witnesses events that leave everyone stunned.


  An unidentified man is found beaten and shot to death on a lonely country road. The police chief and his wife are butchered on a quiet Sunday morning. Then a bank executive disappears from his home, leaving his keys on the table and his wife frozen with fear.


  The easiest suspect is Jack Reacher - an outsider, a man just passing through. But Reacher is not just any drifter. He is a tough ex-military policeman, trained to think fast and act faster. He has lived with and hunted the worst: the hard men of the American military gone bad.


  When authorities learn the first victim was someone from Reacher's past, and he cannot convince them of his innocence, his patient self-defense becomes a raging crusade of revenge. With two cops who believe in him - a thoughtful black detective and a woman named Roscoe - he closes in on a ruthless conspiracy hiding behind Margrave's rural charm.


  But closing in on him is a team of killers so careful and efficient they are almost invisible. Step by step, the two teams circle - waiting to see which will be the first to walk onto the killing floor.

If you are looking for an entertaining action thriller with a kick-ass ex-military cop who accepts crap from others only to give it back to them in spades–you're in luck. Here he is–Jack Reacher. Jack Reacher is a wanderer, living a minimalistic life off of his militarty pension, wandering the land, getting to know his country.

The *Killing Floor* is the first in the Jack Reacher series. It is a good introduction to the intrepid hero, "wandering cowboy" type, conanesque warrior. This is a great **action** thriller, emphasis on action.

Don't expect every detail to make sense, every T to be crossed, every I to be dotted. This is an action story with a kick-ass warrior who has compassion for victims and none for the evil-doers. Enjoy the story as the Action Romp it is.

As ever, I won't provide any spoilers. The details put out by the publisher from the various book printings should be enough to whet your appetite. Get a copy and enjoy.

**Spoiler (not really)**: There are rumours of a video series in the works for Jack Reacher. (I hear it is a Prime Video venture.)
