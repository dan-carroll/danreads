intro: |
  VX is not a good way to die. So when the President of the United States gets confirmed intelligence that a shipload of the stuff is headed for Florida, he orders that every stop be pulled out. Including bringing in his ultimate weapon: The Kildar.


  Heart-sick over the deaths of so many of his Keldara followers, and one in particular, former SEAL Mike Harmon, hero of [Ghost](/reviews/military_fiction/ghost.html), [Kildar](/reviews/military_fiction/kildar.html), [Choosers of the Slain](/reviews/military_fiction/choosers_of_the_slain.html) and [Unto the Breach](/reviews/military_fiction/unto_the_breach.html), decides to sit this one out. WMDs headed for the US no longer matter to the Kildar.


  But when his best friend and intel specialist both are seriously wounded in an ambush aimed at him, the Kildar gets his gameface back on. The terrorists will learn to fear the Ghost all over again.


  Mike has always said that he's not a nice guy, and he's about to prove it to a boatload of terrorists and Colombian drug dealers. Set in the Bahamas and Florida Keys, *A Deeper Blue* is a fast moving thriller that never slows down from the first page. With the return of some old faces, the action-packed novel proves, once again, the adage that sometimes it takes some very bad people to do good things.

Military action adventure at it's best. This is one heck of an adventure, with more than enough military action and tech to satisfy anyone's thirst. And it is close to home, coming to the good ole U.S. of A. and my homeâ€“Florida.

Truly, more action than a block buster movie. The bad guys are in for it now. They have pissed off the *Best of the Best* and are going to get their due desserts. Another great military adventure story from John Ringo. Keep them coming man!
