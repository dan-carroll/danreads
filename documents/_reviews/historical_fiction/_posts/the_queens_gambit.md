intro: "Eight-year-old orphan Beth Harmon is quiet, sullen, and by all appeasrances unremarkable. That is until she plays her first game of chess. Her senses grow sharper, her thinking clearer, and for the first time in her life she feels herself fully in control. By the age of sixteen, she's competing for the U.S. Open championship. But as Beth hones her skills on the professional circuit, the stakes get higher, her isolation grows more frightening, and the thought of escape becomes all the more tempting. Engaging and fast-paced, *The Queen's Gambit* speeds to a conclusion as elegant and satisfying as a mate in four."

I admit I read the book because I had watched the mini-series on Netflix. I found the series entertaining and mildly suspenseful. Enough attention grabbing power that my wife and I watched the seven episode series in three sittings.

This book is a great read even after having watched the video. It caught my attention and I couldn't put it down for any great length of time. Not my usual type of read but now I find myself contemplating the author's other books.

This was my first read of a Walter Tevis book but it won't be my last. I am also looking forward to checking out the movies based on some of his other books. *The Color of Money* being one that I may have already seen but need to read and watch, again.

Walter Tevis did a first-rate job with *The Queen's Gambit*. Definitely fulfilling my criteria of being a good story-teller. Who knew that a male college professor could get into the mind of a pre-teen girl and take his readers along for the journey into womanhood.

That is what makes this book, and movie, great entertainment. The movie (mini-series) takes one through the story with visuals and dialogue. But the book provides a "behind the scenes" look into the mind of a young girl finding her way in the world and maturing into an independent young woman.

A great read. Very entertaining and attention-grabbing. Worth a read, more than once. Now I feel the need to get one of my old chess sets, maybe both, out of the closet and dusted off.
