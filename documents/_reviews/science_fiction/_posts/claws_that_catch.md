  Humans have come a long ways since the looking glass gates first appeared and an alien menace turned a motley crew of scientists, sailors and force recon Marines into battle-hardened space adventurers. Now with other species running scared, it’s up to humans to take the lead and mold a weapon capable of checking the Dreen—a galactic cancer that has so far proved unstoppable. Their arsenal A hodge-podge of powerful technologies begged, borrowed and/or looted from across the galaxy and cobbled together on what has to be the strangest ship ever to ply the starways: the good ship Vorpal Blade II!

intro: |
  Best-selling author John Ringo–a former member of the elite 82nd Airborne Division–and real-life rocket scientist Travis S. Taylor bring an unmatched level of authenticity to their action-packed military science fiction. *Claws That Catch* is the fourth volume from their popular *Looking Glass* series. 


  Working off of a piece of intelligence from the alien Hexosehr, the *Vorpal Blade* is dispatched to investigate rumors of an ancient and powerful civilization that may have been the creators of the “black box” that drives humanity's only space ship. Any remnant technology would be nice but what the Blade finds is much more than they bargained for. Worse, the ship is infested by an alien species of scorpion-like arachnoids that has the potential to wipe out a world.


  Worst of all, instead of being Astrogator, Captain William Weaver is now the XO and he is not getting along with the new commander. And the new commander does not get along with Weaver, the ship's female savant-linguist or most of the rest of the original crew. And what is that weird noise the ship makes every time it's in hard maneuvers?


  Leave it to the oddball geniuses of the *Blade* to sort it all out. And the Dreen are not going to like the answers.

Another great read from the team of John Ringo and Travis S. Taylor. Realistic space adventure that is hard to put down. I am already a fan of John Ringo. Now I am going to have to look up more of Travis Taylor's books.

*Claws That Catch* cements the earthlings right to be out in space when they are the only hope of other civilizations. What a fantastic yarn this series has been. Great story-telling at it's finest.
