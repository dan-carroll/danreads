intro: |
  The sequel to *Into the Looking Glass*. William Weaver, PhD. and SEAL Chief Adams are back and Bill got himself a ship!


  The former SSBN Nebraska has been converted, using mostly garage mechanics and baling wire, into a warp ship ready to go "out there." But as everyone knows, the people who really are going to bear the brunt are the poor Security guys, Force Recon Marines who are kept in the dark and fed manure all day. That is until they land on an alien planet, get partially wiped out and then load back up again.


  Ranging in topics from the best gun to kill armored space monsters to particle physics to cosmology to health and beauty tips, Vorpal Blade is a return to the "good old days" of SF when the science problems were intractable and the beasts were ugly. The monkeys are out in the space lanes and ready to rock. As soon as they get another roll of duct tape.

The follow-up to *[Into the Looking Glass](/reviews/science_fiction/into_the_looking_glass.html)*, *Vorpal Blade* is a rollicking, action-packed adventure into space aboard the earth's first warp-driven spaceship – which happens to be a converted ballistic missile submarine. True-to-life militaristic action with believable technology utilizing a piece of alien technology to effect warp drive capabilities. And John Ringo is just a great story-teller.

His books are amazing feats of the literray art. At least for those who love good story-telling with plenty of action. Grab yourself a copy of *Vorpal Blade* and hit the starways for some serious action in a hard-to-put-down read.
