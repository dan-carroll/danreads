intro: |
  Ancient, ultimate evil threatened the Elves and the Races of Man. For the Ellcrys, the tree created by long-lost Eleven magic, was dying, loosing the spell of Forbidding that locked the hordes of ravening Demons away from Earth. Already the Reaper, most fearsome of Demons, was free. Only one source of protection was powerfil enough to stop it: *The Elfstones of Shannara*.
  
  
  The Stones and the right to use them belonged to Wil, given him by his grandfather Shea. And now Allanon, legendary Druid guardian of the Races, summoned him from his studies in Storlock to protect Amberle, the Elven girl who must carry a seed of the tree to the mysterious Bloodfire, life-source of earth, there to be quickened and to create a new Ellcrys.
  
  
  While Allanon and the Elves fight a hopeledd war against the emerging multitudes of Demons, Wil and Amberle plunge forward in a seemingly impossible quest for the Bloodfire. Before them lie unknown dangers, impassable barriers, and the savage Wilderun, from which none have ever escaped.
  
  
  Behind them follows the Reaper. Against it, Wil has the Elfstonesâ€“but he has lost all power to control them. Weaponless, he and Amberle watch as the shadow of the Reaper appears on the trail before them...

I have revisited this story in the form of *The Shannara Chronicles* on *Netflix*. My interest in the original Shannara trilogy has been rekindled. So I am placing this book back on my to be read list. I will share my opinions after reading this title again.
