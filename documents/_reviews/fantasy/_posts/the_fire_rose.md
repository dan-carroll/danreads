intro: |
  Beauty Meets Beast in San Francisco


  Accepting employment as a governess after hard times hit her family, medieval scholar Rosalind Hawkins is surprised when she learns that her mysterious employer has no children, no wife, and she is not to meet with him face to face. Instead, her duties are to read to him, through a speaking tube, from ancient manuscripts in obscure, nearly-forgotten dialects.


  A requirement for the job was skill in translating medieval French, and she now understands the reason for that requirement, and assumes her unseen employerâ€™s interest in the descriptions of medieval spells and sorcery is that of an eccentric antiquary. What she does not realize is that his interest is anything but academic. He has a terrible secret and is desperately searching for something that can reverse the effects of the misfired spell which created his predicament.

Beauty meets Beast, but not in the typical fashion. There is mystery and intrigue involved, along with love and magic.

A great story with a contextual backdrop quite different from the usual fairy tale. This story has a familiar historical context, for Americans at least, that aids in the visualization in the mind's eye.

Definitely not a Disney princess story. But would make for a great movie script.
