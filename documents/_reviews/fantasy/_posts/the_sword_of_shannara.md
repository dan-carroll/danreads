A great first novel by author *Terry Brooks*. An excellent story with easily identifiable characters. This book is long enough to tell the story but nowhere near as long as some tomes in the Fantasy genre.

I enjoyed this book so much I had to reread it again a few years later. Now I need to reread the whole trilogy again. I have been "woke" by what I discovered in the Netflix series "*The Shannara Chronicles*". These stories occur in a future version of our own earth, not in some fairytale land.
