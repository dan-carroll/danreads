intro: |
  Horror stalked the Four Lands as the Ildatch, ancient source of evil, stirred to new life. Once it had sought dominion through the Dark Lord and his dread Skull Bearers. Now it sent the ghastly Mord Wraiths out to create war and destroy Mankind.
  
  
  And again Allanon, legendary Druid protector of the Races, had to seek aid from a descendant of the Elven King Shannara. For Brin, daughter of Wil Ohmsford, held the magic power of the wishsong. To her, it was only something to make plants bloom instantly or to turn trees from summer green to autumn gold. But to Allanon, it was the only means to penetrate the vile growth that protected the Ildatch. Reluctantly, Brin joined the Druid on his perilous journey eastward.
  
  
  Behind, her younger brother Jair was soon kidnapped by gnomes and also forced eastward. Then, finally freed, he learned from the mysterious King of the Silver River that Brin was doomed to fail and die–unless Jair could somehow reach her in time!
  
  
  With a strange band of companions, Jair set out–through the very heart of evil, where death threatened at every step. And ahead, the Ildatch waited, nursing its plans to trap Brin into a fate far more horrible than death!

I will have to get back to you on my opinions of this book. Putting this book back on my to be read pile. Time for another visit.
