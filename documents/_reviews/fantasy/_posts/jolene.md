intro: "Anna May Jones is the daughter of a coal miner, but a sickly constitution has kept her confined to the house for most of her life. Hoping to improve her daughter’s health—and lessen the burden on their family—Anna's mother sends her to live with her Aunt Jinny, a witchy-woman and an Elemental Master, in a holler outside of Ducktown.
 
 
As she settles into her new life, Anna learns new skills at Aunt Jinny’s side and discovers that she, too, has a gift for Elemental magic that Jinny calls “the Glory”. She also receives lessons from a mysterious and bewitching woman named Jolene, who assures her that, with time, Anna could become even more powerful than her aunt.
 
 
But with Anna’s increasing power comes increasing notice. Billie McDaran, the foreman of the Ducktown mine, begins to take an interest in Anna and her abilities—even though Anna has already fallen in love with a young man with a talent for stonecarving.
 
 
If she wants to preserve the life she has come to love, Anna must use her newfound powers to oppose the foreman and protect those around her."

Another great book by [Mercedes Lackey](/authors/mercedes_lackey.html). I so enjoy a good story by a great storyteller. This is the 15th book in her Elemental Masters series.

It starts out a little slow but the back story is important to this tale. The story's pace does pick up and the reader may want to pay attention to the 19th century mountain dialogue.

The central character Anna is endearing and grows up in a matter of months as the story progresses. Her view of her world and the people around her is a bit innocent, without guile. But she does grow in confidence, ability, and power.

I do not like to give away story lines. No spoilers here. As always though, if I am writing about it, it is a good read.

There are magical influences, characters and creatures from the old world and the new world, as well as a character introduced from Russian folklore. [The Queen of Copper Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mistress_of_the_Copper_Mountain){:target="_blank"}, also known as the titular *Jolene*, has a duality of character that bodes ill, or well, for humans who encounter her. Get the book and read it to get the full story.
