		  Okay, simple intro above, but really, I am a bookworm. I have always loved reading. And I would love to share what I have read. But it is not always easy to find someone willing to listen to me rave about my reads.
		</p>
		<p class="lead mx-auto" style="width: 45rem;">
		  So, here I am blogging about my reads. My interests are varied but I may end up with way too many science fiction titles here. But I am also into the fantasy genre, to a certain extent. Along with westerns, adventure, military action, historical fiction (some), and suspenseful mystery thrillers (with some action).
		</p>
		<p class="lead mx-auto" style="width: 45rem;">
		  I do read some books intended for youth, especially when there is suspense and adventure involoved. Basically, the same genres of fiction i like are readable whether meant for a young audience or a more mature one. I really look for a good story being told by a masterful storyteller.
		</p>
		<p class="lead mx-auto" style="width: 45rem;">
		  You may also see some children's books here. After all, I am a Pa-Pa. Need to read to the grandkids. I am making an effort to foster a love of reading in a new generation. And books do make great gifts.
		</p>
		<p class="lead mx-auto" style="width: 45rem;">
		  As for non-fiction, I primarily read STEAM – Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math – books. But also interested in Finance, Self-improvement, Inspirational, Gardening, Woodworking, Health, Cooking, and Nature subjects. So definitely not limited to a single genre.
