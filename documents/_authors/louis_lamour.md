quote_about: 
intro: "More than just a writer of Westerns, Louis L'Amour was a grand story teller. I used to keep a folded note in my wallet with the title of each of his books I had read. I scoured bookstores and libraries looking for the odd one I hadn't read yet. I quit tallying these titles somewhere after 60+."
