factoid: "If you’ve read my first novel, KILLING FLOOR, you might remember it’s written in first person. It isn’t until Chapter Two when someone asks my main character for his name. I had no idea. My wife enlisted me to help her with the shopping, and while I was at the store a nice little old lady asked if I would reach some cans placed on a high shelf. After she thanked me, my wife said if the writing didn’t work out, I could get a job as a “reacher” in a supermarket and I thought, \"Good name!\""

Jack Reacher is an interesting character. I give James Grant – yeah, Lee Child is a pen name – kudos for his character development. And for writing such a serioudly entertaining series of books.

This author deserves recognintion as a great storyteller. I always look forward to the next Jack Reacher novel. Too bad he is moving on to other ventures.

I am very hopeful that his collaborations with his brother Andrew will leave us with more great stories to read. I have the latest one, *The Sentinel*, in my To-Be-Read stack on the coffee table. Can't wait.

Mr. Grant, You have done a fantastic job giving us a man's man, and a soldier's soldier. You have done us vets proud. Pretty darn realistic soldier's attitude in Jack Reacher.
