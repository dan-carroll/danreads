I love great storytellers. And Andre Norton is up there with the best of them. I remember reading *The Time Traders* and *Galactic Derelic* years ago. Great reads both. But the stories are a bit dated.

Looking into the life of Ms. Norton and reviewing some of her books I have read, I found that she has combined these two titles into one, *Time Traders*. And she has updated the details to include more recent world developments and newer technology. Another read to add to my list.

More to come...
